Devops: DevOps is a culture and set of practices that aim to unify software development (Dev) and software operation (Ops). It emphasizes collaboration, automation, continuous delivery, and monitoring.
DevOps is a cultural shift that combines development and operations teams to create, test, and release software faster and more reliably. It's not just a set of tools or a process, but a mindset that emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. 
 Key Concepts:

Faster delivery of features

Improved collaboration and communication

Automation of manual processes

Continuous improvement with feedback loops


8 Phases of DevOps:
Plan – Define requirements and tasks.

Develop – Write code, use Git, pull requests.

Build – Build apps using tools like Maven, Gradle.

Test – Run tests automatically.

Release – Prepare the release artifacts.

Deploy – Push code to servers/cloud.

Operate – Manage infrastructure, keep things running.

Monitor – Get insights, logs, and metrics.

Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor
